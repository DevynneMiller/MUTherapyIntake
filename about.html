            <p>The MU Therapy office has been offering help and treatments to patients at Mizzou.  The office povides patients with primary care, therapy, and special help.  This database was created to give the office an organized way of adding new patients as well as keeping up with them when they visit the Occupational Therapy office.  This way, MU Therapy won't have to have their intake forms on paper anymore, and will be able to use a secure and effecient database to spend more time taking better care of their their patients. </p>
